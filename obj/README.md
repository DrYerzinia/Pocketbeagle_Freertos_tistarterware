This is a dummy readme file. GIT does not allow directories that do not contain
any files. So this README.md file makes the obj directory "look" like it has a
valid file.

Note that the real reason for the obj directory, is that it is used in the make
stage to hold some built objects. These objects are removed on a make clean.
